# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an OpenAI-compatible API proxy that translates OpenAI API requests to AWS Bedrock calls. The system will be deployed using AWS SAM framework with Lambda functions, API Gateway, and ACM certificates, allowing users to seamlessly use existing OpenAI client libraries (like langchain or openai-python) with AWS Bedrock as the backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use existing OpenAI client libraries with AWS Bedrock, so that I can leverage Bedrock's models without changing my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets OPENAI_API_KEY=$AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK and OPENAI_API_BASE=https://openai.${domain}/v1 THEN the system SHALL accept requests from OpenAI client libraries
2. WHEN the system receives an OpenAI-formatted request THEN it SHALL translate the request to AWS Bedrock format
3. WHEN AWS Bedrock returns a response THEN the system SHALL translate it back to OpenAI-compatible format
4. WHEN using langchain or openai-python libraries THEN they SHALL work without modification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to be deployed through AWS SAM framework, so that I can manage infrastructure as code and ensure consistent deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN SAM SHALL provision all required AWS resources
2. WHEN the SAM template is executed THEN it SHALL create Lambda functions with Node.js 22 runtime on ARM64 architecture
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN API Gateway SHALL be configured with proper routing
4. WHEN infrastructure changes are needed THEN they SHALL be managed through SAM template updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the API to be accessible via HTTPS with a custom domain, so that I can securely access the service with a memorable URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use ACM-issued SSL certificates
2. WHEN a domain parameter is provided THEN the API SHALL be accessible at https://openai.${domain}/v1
3. WHEN no custom domain is specified THEN the system SHALL default to openai.${domain} format
4. WHEN HTTPS requests are made THEN they SHALL be properly terminated and secured

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Lambda function to handle request conversion efficiently, so that API calls have minimal latency and cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function receives a request THEN it SHALL run on Node.js 22 runtime
2. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN it SHALL use ARM64 architecture for cost optimization
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the function SHALL convert OpenAI format to Bedrock format accurately
4. WHEN handling responses THEN the function SHALL maintain OpenAI API compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to authenticate using AWS bearer tokens, so that access is controlled through AWS IAM policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request includes OPENAI_API_KEY with AWS bearer token THEN the system SHALL validate the token
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the request SHALL be forwarded to AWS Bedrock
4. IF the bearer token is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API endpoint coverage, so that I can use all necessary OpenAI API features with Bedrock.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives chat completion requests THEN it SHALL support /v1/chat/completions endpoint with proper message format translation
2. WHEN the system receives model listing requests THEN it SHALL support /v1/models endpoint returning available Bedrock models
3. WHEN chat completion requests include system, user, and assistant messages THEN the system SHALL properly map them to Bedrock's message format
4. WHEN streaming responses are requested THEN the system SHALL support server-sent events (SSE) format compatible with OpenAI
5. WHEN unsupported endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes and messages
6. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL match OpenAI API response format exactly including usage tokens and model information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS Bedrock returns an error THEN the system SHALL translate it to appropriate OpenAI-compatible error format
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized with proper error message
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests
4. WHEN invalid requests are made THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with descriptive error messages
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged to CloudWatch with appropriate detail level

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable model mapping, so that I can control which Bedrock models are exposed through the OpenAI API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load model mappings from environment variables or parameter store
2. WHEN /v1/models is called THEN it SHALL return only configured and available Bedrock models
3. WHEN a model is requested in chat completions THEN the system SHALL map it to the corresponding Bedrock model ID
4. IF an unmapped model is requested THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
